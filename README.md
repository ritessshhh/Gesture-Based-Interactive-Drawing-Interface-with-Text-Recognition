# Gesture Based Interactive Drawing Interface with Text Recognition 

This is an AI-based Hand-Tracking System written in python that lets you select tools in our drawing application by simply pointing your index finger! We used OpenCV and MediaPipe to develop this program that identifies the unique markings of your finger for seamless tool selection.

The design user interface is designed using Canva. This allows for effortless erasure and color selection, making the drawing process smoother and more enjoyable.


Finally, we used PyTesseract to develop a feature that quickly identifies words and numbers that you paint, with an impressive accuracy of 98%. So, unleash your creativity and enjoy a seamless drawing experience with our AI-based Hand-Tracking System and user-friendly interface!
